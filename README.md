Hello and welcome to the README.md file.
Here we will discuss about reading README.md files and the user will also read this README file.

Reading README.md files for basic users:
- Scan the information as you see it.

Reading README.md files for advanced users:
- Historically there had been a table of contents for software. This README.md file does not contain one. Advanced users have used the table of contents to locate the exact information they needed from the software bundle they installed on to their machines.

# Further Developments are to be made in this README.md file!

## Project Ideas:

### Read Files in this git repo with a programming language.

#### Try Python, C, C++, or any language that can deal with files effectively.
